Some of my previous projects

- [Moustachio](Moustachio/README.md): A set of hardware libraries (motor and sensors) for a university project which involved building a small robot capable of solving mazes. (C++ *Arduino*)
- [Rational](Rational/README.md): A rational number library. (C++)
- [XCIS](XCIS/README.md): Some code from an early iteration of the XCIS firmware (C++). Circuit board designs.
- [console](console/README.md): A code chunk from a project attempting to make a basic console using Open GL. (C++)
- [led_display](led_display/README.md): A project getting a Jaycar 16x16 display module working. Plays Conway's game of life. (C++ *Arduino*)
- [timercounter](timercounter/README.md): A project exploring hardware manipulation on the ATMega series microcontrollers. (C++ *Arduino*)
- [LamboCoins](https://github.com/AhemOne/LamboCoins): A project exploring Ethereum and blockchain technology I was working on with a friend as a proof of concept (Solidity/Javascript).
- [Code Golf](https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/users/64644/ahemone?tab=answers): Check out some of my answers to these coding challenges. The focus is on minimal code so some answers are highly obfuscated in favor of tersness. (K&R C)
- [Sous-vide](sousvide/README.md): Some technical drawing produced for a university project which involved designing a kitchen appliance. The group chose to produce a sous-vide machine to fulfill the design goal. (Solidworks)
