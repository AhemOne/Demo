# Cpp JSON

## Introduction

This library converts between JSON and an object representation. The aim of this project is to imitate a JSON/js object type environment for quickly building memory objects, and a JSON interface for parsing and stringifying. The ultimate aim is to provide a library for microcontrollers with small amounts of memory which gives the ability to manipulate JavaScript-like objects to be recieved from or for the transmission to external sources while protecting the allocation table to ensure minimal memory fragmentation.
